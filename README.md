# virtshift: a toolkit to help managing your openshift cluster on libvirt

The [openshift installer](https://github.com/openshift/installer) allows to install openshift on [KVM virtual machiness managed by libvirt](https://github.com/openshift/installer/blob/master/docs/dev/libvirt/README.md) for development purposes.
`virtshift` provides tools, which don't fit in openshift itself, to help you managing these clusters.

Using openshift on libvirt virtual machines is *strongly* *discouraged* for everything besides development purposes.
